process.nextTick(callback)

process.nextTick() is not part of the event loop, it adds the callback into the 
nextTick queue. Node processes all the callbacks in the nextTick queue after 
the current operation completes and before the event loop continues.
Which means it runs before any additional I/O events or timers fire in 
subsequent ticks of the event loop.
